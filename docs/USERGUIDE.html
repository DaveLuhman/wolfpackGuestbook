        <h2>2. Everyday Startup</h2>
        <h3>Launching the Application</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open the Application:</strong> Double-click the desktop shortcut to start the Wolfpack
                Guestbook.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Selection:</strong> Each time the application starts, it will attempt to detect connected
                MagTek HID devices and Symbol DS9208 barcode scanners. If a device is not automatically detected, you'll
                need to connect the device and restart the application.</li>

        <h3>Normal Operation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Swipe Detection:</strong> If a MagTek MSR device is detected, the application will listen for
                card swipes and display the parsed data in the interface. This data is also saved to the local database.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Barcode Scanning:</strong> If a Symbol DS9208 scanner is detected, the application will listen
                for barcode scans. Each successful scan will be processed and saved to the database.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio Feedback:</strong> The application provides audio feedback for successful entries and
                errors. A success sound plays when an entry is recorded, and an error sound plays when there's an issue
                with the entry.</li>
